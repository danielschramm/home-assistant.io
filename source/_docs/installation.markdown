Home Assistant provides multiple ways to be installed. If you are a Raspberry Pi owner then the [Hassbian](/docs/hassbian/) is an easy and simple way to run home Assistant.

The only requirement is that you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. For Windows we require at least **Python 3.5** and for other operating systems at least **Python 3.4.2**.

It may be needed that you install additional library depending on the platforms/components you want to use.
