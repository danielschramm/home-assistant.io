Access to Home Assistant is secured by our authentication system. Each member of your household will get their own user account to log in and access Home Assistant.

Home Assistant contains two different user types: the owner user account and normal users. The owner user account is created when you start Home Assistant for the first time. This account has some special privileges compared to the other users of the system:

 - Manage users
 - Configure integrations and other settings (soon)
 - Configure Hass.io (soon)

## {% linkable_title Authentication %}

When a user wants to use Home Assistant, they have to log in. When navigating to the frontend without authentication, the user is asked for a login. The login page will always show you the website that you're logging in to.

When logging in, make sure that the URL in the URL bar is showing the address of your Home Assistant instance.

## {% linkable_title Profile %}

Once you're logged in, you can access the profile page by clicking on the badge next to the Home Assistant title in the sidebar. Here you can change your preferred language or change your password. You can also log out.

## {% linkable_title Multi-factor authentication  %}

As a user, you can setup multi-factor authentication with time-based one-time passwords. This is an extra challenge that you have to solve after you finish your login. You will be able to set up these challenges from the profile page once you're logged in.

## {% linkable_title Troubleshooting %}

### {% linkable_title Lost owner password %}

While you should hopefully be storing your passwords in a password manager, if you lose the password associated with the owner account the only way to resolve this is to delete *all* the authentication data. You do this by shutting down Home Assistant and deleting the following files from the `.storage/` folder in your [configuration folder](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/):

* `auth`
* `auth_provider.homeassistant`
* `onboarding`

When you start Home Assistant next you'll be required to set up authentication again.
