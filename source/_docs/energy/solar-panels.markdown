Gain insight into your energy production by integrating your solar panels into Home Assistant.

If you also set up [the Solar Forecast integration](/integrations/forecast_solar), you will be able to see expected solar production and automate based on planned production.

## Hardware

Home Assistant will need to know the amount of energy that is being produced. This can be done in various ways.

### Using a CT clamp sensor

CT clamp sensors measure the instantaneous current passing through an electrical wire. To translate this into electrical power (Wh) you also need a voltage measurement, because Power = Current x Voltage.

In Home Assistant we have support for off-the-shelf CT clamp sensors and you can build your own with ESPHome's [CT Clamp Current sensor](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/ct_clamp.html).

The off-the-shelf solution that we advice is the [Shelly EM](https://shop.shelly.cloud/shelly-em-120a-clamp-wifi-smart-home-automation#143). The device has a local API, updates are pushed to Home Assistant and it has a high quality integration.

Devices like Shelly EM/3EM, Iotawatt, Openenergymonitor (EmonPi) measure both current and voltage.

In case of three-phase electrical systems, attention should be drawn to the fact that the current measurement of a given phase is matched to the voltage of the same phase, otherwise the power measurements will be incorrect.

_Attention! Installing CT clamp sensor devices requires opening your electrical cabinet. This work should be done by someone familiar with electrical wiring. Your qualified installer will know how to do this._
