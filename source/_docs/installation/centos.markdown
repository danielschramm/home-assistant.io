To run Python 3.x on [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) or RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), [Software Collections](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/rh-python34/) needs to be activated first.

There are effort in progress to bring Python 3.4 to [Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL)](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) which will allow you to follow the [Fedora Instructions](/docs/installation/fedora/).
