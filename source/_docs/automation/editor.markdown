In Home Assistant 0.45 we have introduced the first version of our automation editor. The editor is still in a very early stage and rough around the edges. For now we are only supporting Chrome but better browser support is planned for the future.

If you just created a new config with Home Assistant then you're all set! Go to the UI and enjoy.

## {% linkable_title Updating your config to use the editor %}

The automation editor reads and writes to the file `automations.yaml` in your configuration folder. Make sure that you have set up the automation component to read from it:

```yaml
# Configuration.yaml example
automation: !include automations.yaml
```

If you still want to use your old automation section, add a label to the old entry:

```yaml
automation old:
- trigger:
    platform: â€¦
```

## {% linkable_title Migrating your automations to automations.yaml %}

If you want to migrate your old automations to use the editor, you'll have to copy them to `automations.yaml`. Make sure that `automations.yaml` remains a list! For each automation that you copy over you'll have to add an id. This can be any string as long as it's unique.

```yaml
# Example automations.yaml entry
- id: my_unique_id  # <-- Required for editor to work.
  alias: Hello world
  trigger:
  - entity_id: sun.sun
    from: below_horizon
    platform: state
    to: above_horizon
  condition:
  - above: 17
    below: 25
    condition: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.temperature
    value_template: '{{ float(state.state) + 2 }}'
  action:
  - service: light.turn_on
```

<p class='note'>
Any comments in the YAML file will be lost when you update an automation via the editor.
