There are various ways to get in touch with the Home Assistant community. It doesn't matter if you have a question, need help, want to request a feature, or just say 'Hi'.

### {% linkable_title Bugs, Feature requests, and alike %}

Have you found an issue in your Home Assistant installation? Please report it in one of the issue trackers. Reporting it there makes it easier to track than in the Mailing list and ensures that it gets fixed.

- [Issue tracker Home Assistant](https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant/issues)
- [Issue tracker home-assistant.io](https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant.io/issues) (Website and documentation)
