There are various ways to get in touch with the Home Assistant community. It doesn't matter if you have a question, need help, want to request a feature, or just say 'Hi'.

### {% linkable_title Communication channels %} 

- [Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/home-assistant-dev)
- [Real-time messaging](https://gitter.im/balloob/home-assistant)
- [Forum](https://automic.us/forum/)

### {% linkable_title Bugs, Feature requests, and alike %}

Have you found an issue in your Home Assistant installation? Please report it in one of the issue trackers. Reporting it here makes it easier to track than in the Mailing list and ensures that it gets fixed.

- [Issue tracker Home Assistant](https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant/issues)
- [Issue tracker home-assistant.io](https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant.io/issues) (Website and documentation)

### {% linkable_title Roadmap %}

There is no explicit roadmap available but the public [tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1250084) can give you some insight into what is going on.

### {% linkable_title Commercial vendors %}

If you are a commercial vendor and would like to get your product integrated into Home Assistant, please submit a [Pull request](https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant/pulls) or get in touch with us.
