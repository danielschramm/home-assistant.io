The default way to update Home Assistant to the latest release, when available, is:

```bash
$ pip3 install --upgrade homeassistant
```

Different installation methods as [Raspberry Pi All-In-One Installer](/getting-started/installation-raspberry-pi-all-in-one/#upgrading), [Vagrant](/getting-started/installation-vagrant/), or [Virtualenv](/getting-started/installation-virtualenv/#upgrading-home-assistant) may have an alternative way for updating Home Assistant. 

After updating, restart Home Assistant for the changes to take effect. This means that you have to restart `hass` itself or the [autostarting](/getting-started/autostart/) daemon if you use any.


<p class='note note'>
  The upgrade needs to be run as the same user as the installation was done to avoid permission errors.

[BRUH automation](http://www.bruhautomation.com) has created [a tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuG2rs1Cl2Y) explaining how to upgrade Home Assistant.

#### {% linkable_title Run the development version %}
If you want to stay on top of the development of Home Assistant then you can upgrade to the `dev` branch. 

<p class='note warning'>
  This can result in an unstable system, loss of data, etc. etc.
</p>

```bash
$ pip3 install --upgrade git+git://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.git@dev
```
