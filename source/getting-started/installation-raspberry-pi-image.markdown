The easiest way to install Home Assistant on your Raspberry Pi is by using Hassbian: a Raspberry Pi image with Home Assistant built-in. The image will install the latest version of Home Assistant on initial boot (~5 minutes).

 1. [Download the latest image][image-download]
 2. Flash the image to an SD card:
   - [Windows][flash-windows]
   - [Linux][flash-linux]
   - [Mac][flash-macos]
 3. Ensure your Raspberry Pi has access to the internet.
 4. Insert SD card to Raspberry Pi and turn it on. Initial installation of Home Assistant will take 5 minutes.

These instructions are also available as a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIz6XqDwHEk).

Home Assistant will now be available by navigating with a browser to `http://ip-address-of-pi:8123`. The default username is `pi` and password is `raspberry` (please change this by running `passwd`). The Home Assistant configuration is located at `/home/homeassistant/.homeassistant/`.

The following extras are included on the image:

 - GPIO pins are ready to use.
 - Mosquitto MQTT broker is installed (not activated by default).
 - Bluetooth is ready to use (supported models only, no Bluetooth LE).

Some extra tips:

 - Check out the list of [Raspberry Pi hardware specific components][pi-components].
 - Z-Wave support can be installed by following the [Getting started instructions for Z-Wave](/getting-started/z-wave/).
