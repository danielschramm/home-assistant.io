##### {% linkable_title Motion or alarm sensors %}

In order for Home Assistant to recognize well the sensor, you will need to change its configuration from `Basic Set (default)` to `Binary Sensor report` or `Alarm report`. Currently there's no way to do this in Home Assistant but you can use ozwcp (OpenZWave control panel), Domoticz or similar to do it
These devices will either show as a binary sensor or a sensor called `Alarm xxxx` and will report a numeric value. Test to see what value is what. Sometimes this is noted in the device manual.


##### {% linkable_title Locks and other secure devices %}

These devices require a network key to be set for the zwave network before they are paired. This key is set in OpenZwave's `options.xml` which is located in Open Zwave's directory. This should also be the same directory as `config_path:` in your `configuration.yaml`. If it's not, make sure you have the same values in all the files you are using.
The option is commented out by default in `options.xml` and is a default key. Make your own unique key. The key is in Hexadecimals.
It is best to pair these devices in Open Zwave Control Panel or other Zwave tool that can show you logs while pairing. Test the device before you save the configuration.
Make sure you copy the newly saved `zwcfg_[home_id].xml`into your HomeAssistant config directory.

##### {% linkable_title Event basic_level for automation %}
HomeAssistant will trigger a event when command_class_basic changes value on a node.
This can be virtually anything, so tests have to be made to determine what value equals what.
You can use this for automations.

Example:
```yaml
- alias: Minimote Button Pressed
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: zwave.basic_level
    event_data:
      entity_id: aeon_labs_minimote_1
      basic_level: 255
```

##### {% linkable_title Event scene_id for automation %}
HomeAssistant will trigger a event when a scene is activated by a node in the zwave network.
This can be a press of a button, so tests have to be made to determine what scene_id equals what.
You can use this for automations.

Example:
```yaml
- alias: Minimote Button 1 Pressed
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: zwave.scene_activated
    event_data:
      entity_id: aeon_labs_minimote_1
      scene_id: 1
```


##### {% linkable_title Aeon Minimote %}

Here's a handy configuration for the Aeon Labs Minimote that defines all possible button presses. Put it into `automation.yaml`.

```yaml
- alias: Minimote Button 1 Pressed
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: zwave.scene_activated
    event_data:
      entity_id: aeon_labs_minimote_1
      scene_id: 1

- alias: Minimote Button 1 Held
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: zwave.scene_activated
    event_data:
      entity_id: aeon_labs_minimote_1
      scene_id: 2

- alias: Minimote Button 2 Pressed
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: zwave.scene_activated
    event_data:
      entity_id: aeon_labs_minimote_1
      scene_id: 3

- alias: Minimote Button 2 Held
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: zwave.scene_activated
    event_data:
      entity_id: aeon_labs_minimote_1
      scene_id: 4

- alias: Minimote Button 3 Pressed
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: zwave.scene_activated
    event_data:
      entity_id: aeon_labs_minimote_1
      scene_id: 5

- alias: Minimote Button 3 Held
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: zwave.scene_activated
    event_data:
      entity_id: aeon_labs_minimote_1
      scene_id: 6

- alias: Minimote Button 4 Pressed
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: zwave.scene_activated
    event_data:
      entity_id: aeon_labs_minimote_1
      scene_id: 7

- alias: Minimote Button 4 Held
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: zwave.scene_activated
    event_data:
      entity_id: aeon_labs_minimote_1
      scene_id: 8
```
