It can happen that you run into trouble while installing Home Assistant. This page is here to help you figure out the most common problems.

Check if Python 3.4 is installed by running `python3 --version`. If it is not installed, [download it here](https://www.python.org/getit/).

Pip should come bundled with the latest Python 3 but is ommitted by some distributions. If you are unable to run `python3 -m pip --version` you can install pip by [downloading the installer](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run it with Python 3: `python3 get-pip.py`.

Check if Git is installed by running `git --version`. If you are unable to run this command you can install it by following [these instructions](http://git-scm.com/downloads).
