It can happen that you run into trouble while installing Home Assistant. This page is here to help you figure out the most common problems.

Check if Python3 is installed by running `python3 --version`. If it is not installed, install it here.

Pip should come bundled with the latest Python3 but is ommitted by some distributions. If you are unable to run `python3 -m pip --version` you can install pip by [downloading the installer](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run it with Python3: `python3 get-pip.py`.

Check if Git is installed by running `git --version`. If you are unable to run this command you can install it by following [these instructions](http://git-scm.com/downloads).
