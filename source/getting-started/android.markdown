Home Assistant is not available on the Play Store. Instead, Home Assistant leverages the new [manifest.json support](https://w3c.github.io/manifest/) to allow Android devices to add the web application to your homescreen as if it was a native application.

  1. Open Chrome
  2. Navigate to your Home Assistant instance
  3. Click on the menu icon (three vertical dots)
  4. Click on Add to Homescreen
  5. A dialog will popup, click on Add
