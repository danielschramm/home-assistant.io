Home Assistant is not available on the Play Store or App Store. Instead, Home Assistant leverages the new [manifest.json support](https://w3c.github.io/manifest/) to allow Mobile devices to add the web application to your homescreen as if it was a native application.

On Android:

  1. Open Chrome
  2. Navigate to your Home Assistant instance
  3. Click on the menu icon (three vertical dots)
  4. Click on Add to Homescreen
  5. A dialog will popup, click on Add

  2. Navigate to your Home Assistant instance
  3. Click on the share icon in the middle of the toolbar (on the bottom)
  4. Click on Add to Home Screen
  5. A dialog will popup, click on Add
