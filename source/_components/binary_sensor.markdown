Binary sensors are gathering information about state of switches, contacts, pins, and alike. The return value of those sensors is usually digital (1/0). This means that those sensors knows only two states: **off/low/open** and **on/high/closed**.

Knowing that there are only two states allows Home Assistant to represent the sensor better in the frontend.

For analog sensors please check the [component overview](https://home-assistant.io/components/#sensor).
