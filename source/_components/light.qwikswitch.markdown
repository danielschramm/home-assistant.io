The `qwikswitch` platform allows you to control your [QwikSwitch](http://www.qwikswitch.co.za/) Relays and Dimmers as lights from within Home Assistant.

They will be automatically discovered if the discovery component is enabled.

For more configuration information see the [QwikSwitch component](/components/qwikswitch/) documentation.
