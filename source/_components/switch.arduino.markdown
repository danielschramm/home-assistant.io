The `arduino` switch platform allows you to control the digital pins of your [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) board. Support for switching pins is limited to high/on and low/off of the digital pins. PWM (pin 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 on an Arduino Uno) is not supported yet.

To enable the Arduino pins with Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  platform: arduino
  pins:
    11:
      name: Fan Office
      type: digital
    12:
      name: Light Desk
      type: digital
      default: on
      negate: true
```

Configuration variables:

- **pins** (*Required*): Array of pins to use. The number corresponds with the pin numbering schema of your board.
  - **name**: Name that will be used in the frontend for the pin.
  - **type**: The type of the pin. At the moment only 'digital' is supported.
  - **default**: The initial value for this port.
  - **negate**: If this pin should be inverted.

The digital pins are numbered from 0 to 13. The available pins are 2 till 13. For testing purposes you can use pin 13 because with that pin you can control the internal LED.
