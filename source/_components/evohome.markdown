The `evohome` platform is the main component to set up and integrate all supported evohome Climate devices.

It uses the [evohomeclient](https://pypi.org/project/evohomeclient/) client library and so will let you control (only) _EU-based_ [Honeywell Connect Comfort](https://international.mytotalconnectcomfort.com/Account/Login) systems.

Currently, only Controllers and Zones are supported; support for DHW controllers will be added at a later time. More information is available [evohome climate component](/components/climate.honeywell/) page.

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To use this component in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
evohome:
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

This is an IoT cloud-polling device, and the `scan_interval` is currently fixed at 5 minutes.  Testing has indicated that this is a safe interval that - by itself - shouldn't cause you to be rate-limited by Honeywell.
