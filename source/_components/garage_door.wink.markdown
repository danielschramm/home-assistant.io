Wink garage door functionality is currently limited to view only. Wink garage doors will still show the current state of the door, but control has been disabled for third parties. If you have a Chamberlain garage door, and would like to control it via Home Assistant, please contact Chamberlain and request that they re-enabled third-party control.

The following quote is from Wink.

<blockquote>
As part of our agreement with Chamberlain, third-party access to control Chamberlain garage doors has been restricted. Please contact Chamberlain directly to inquire about permissions.
</blockquote>

~~The Wink garage door platform allows you to control your [Wink](http://www.wink.com/) enabled garage door.~~

The requirement is that you have setup your [Wink hub](/components/wink/).
