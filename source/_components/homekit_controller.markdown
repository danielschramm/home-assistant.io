[HomeKit](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/) controller integration for Home Assistant allows you to connect HomeKit accessories to Home Assistant. This component should not be confused with the [HomeKit](/components/homekit/) component, which allows you to control Home Assistant devices via HomeKit.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Light](/components/light.homekit_controller/)
- [Switch](/components/switch.homekit_controller/)

The component will be automatically configured if the [`discovery:`](components/discovery/) component is enabled and an enable entry added for HomeKit:

```yaml
discovery:
  enable:
    - homekit
```

For each detected HomeKit accessory, a configuration prompt will appear in the web front end. Use this to provide the HomeKit PIN.
