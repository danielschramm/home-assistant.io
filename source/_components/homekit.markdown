The `HomeKit` component allows you to forward entities from Home Assistant to Apple `HomeKit`, so they could be controlled from Apple `Home` app and `Siri`.

{% configuration %}
  homekit:
    description: HomeKit configuration.
    required: true
    type: map
    keys:
      pincode:
        description: Pin code required during setup of HomeKit Home Assistant accessory. The format needs to be 'XXX-XX-XXX' where X is a number between 0 and 9.
        required: false
        type: string
        default: '"123-45-678"'
      port:

        type: int

{% endconfiguration %}

## {% linkable_title Setup %}

To enable the `HomeKit` component in Home Assistant, add the following to your configuration file:

```yaml
# Example for HomeKit setup
homekit:
  pincode: '123-45-678'
```

<p class='note'>It is not recommended to choose '123-45-678' as your pin code!</p>

After Home Assistant has started, all supported entities (see the [list](#supported-components) below which components are already integrated) will be exposed to `HomeKit`. To add them:
1. Open the `Home` App.
2. Choose `Add Accessory` and then `Don't Have a Code or Can't Scan?`.
3. The `Home Assistant` Bridge should be listed there. Select it and follow the instructions to complete setup.

After the setup is completed you should be able to control your Home Assistant components through `Home` and `Siri`.

## {% linkable_title Supported Components %}

The following components are currently supported:

| Component | Type Name | Description |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| alarm_control_panel | SecuritySystem | All security systems. |
| climate | Thermostat | All climate devices. |
| cover | Window | All covers that support `set_cover_position`. |
| sensor | TemperatureSensor | All sensors that have `Celsius` and `Fahrenheit` as their `unit_of_measurement`. |
| switch/remote | Switch | All switches or remotes (represented as switches). |

<p class='note'>Currently only devices that are setup when Home Assistant is starting can be exposed to `HomeKit`. This means that especially `Z-Wave` components are currently not supported, since they will be setup afterwards. We are working on a solution for this problem.</p>
