The `insteon-local` component lets you use your [Insteon Hub](http://www.insteon.com/insteon-hub/) with Home Assistant.

To integrate your Insteon(local) with Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml platform entry
insteon_local:
  host: YOUR HUB IP
  username: YOUR HUB USERNAME
  password: YOUR HUB PASSWORD
  timeout: 10
  port: 25105
```

The Insteon(local) component currently supports both lights(dimmers) and switches. A full configuration may look like so:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml platform entry
insteon_local:
  host: YOUR HUB IP
  username: YOUR HUB USERNAME
  password: YOUR HUB PASSWORD
  timeout: 10
  port: 25105

light:
  - platform: insteon_local
  
switch:
  - platform: insteon_local  
```

Configuration variables:

- **username** (*Required*): The username used to access the Insteon interface (find in your Insteon app).
- **password** (*Required*): The password used to access the Insteon interface.
- **host** (*Required*): The ip address of your hub.
- **timeout** (*Optional*): Timeout to wait for connection. (default: 10)
- **port** (*Optional*): The port your hub is configured to listen to.  (default: 25105)
