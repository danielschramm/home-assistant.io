How to obtain IR/RF packet while in learning mode?

Run: hass --script broadlink --ip `YOUR_DEVICE_IP` --mac `YOUR_DEVICE_MAC`

If the orange LED is on point the remote to device and press the matching button on remote.
If the orange LED is off it means the learning is successful and packet will be printed on console.
Then you can copy and paste this packet.
