The Nest component is the main component to integrate all Nest related platforms. Besides this component you will have to setup your thermostat and any connected sensors separately.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
nest:
  username: USERNAME
  password: PASSWORD

thermostat:
  platform: nest
```

Configuration variables:

- **username** (*Required*): Your Nest username.
- **password** (*Required*): Your Nest password.
