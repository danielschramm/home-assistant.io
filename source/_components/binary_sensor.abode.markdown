The `abode` security control panel platform allows you to control your [Abode](https://goabode.com/) alarms.

This component will automatically add `Door Contact`, `Motion Camera`, `Water Sensor`, `Keypad`, `Glass Break`, and `Status Display` binary sensors that are configured in your Abode account.

The requirement is that you have setup your [Abode hub](/components/abode/).
