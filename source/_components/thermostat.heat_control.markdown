Heat Control is a thermostat implemented in Home Assistant. It uses a sensor and a switch connected to a heater under the hood. If the measured temperature is cooler then the target temperature, the heater will be turned on and turned off when required temperature is reached.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
thermostat:
  platform: heat_control
  name: Study
  heater: switch.study_heater
  target_sensor: sensor.study_temperature
  min_temp: 15
  max_temp: 21
  target_temp: 15
```

Configuration variables:

- **name** (*Required*): Name of thermostat
- **heater** (*Required*: `entity_id` for heater switch, must be a toggle device.
- **target_sensor** (*Required*): `entity_id` for a temperature sensor, target_sensor.state must be temperature.
- **min_temp** (*Optional*): Set minimum set point available (default: 7)
- **max_temp** (*Optional*): Set maximum set point available (default: 35)
- **target_temp** (*Required*): Set intital target temperature. Failure to set this variable will result in target temperature being set to null on startup.
- **ac_mode** (*Optional*): Set the switch specified in the *heater* option to be treated as a cooling device instead of a heating device.
