The `iss` platform uses the [Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/) to let you know if the station is above your home location. This means that ISS is 10Â° above the horizon of your home.

You can check in the attributes of the sensor to see the timestamp for the next rise of the station, its current coordinates, and the number of people in space.

To add ISS binary sensor to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: iss
```

Configuration variables:

- **show_on_map** (*Optional*): Option to show the position of the ISS on the map. Defaults to `False`.
