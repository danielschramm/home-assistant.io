<div class='note warning'>

  For a couple of weeks / months this integration is broken, therefore it will be removed in the future according to [this pull request](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/26035).

</div>

The `googlehome` integration allows you to connect to your Google Home device using an [unofficial Google Home API][googlehomeapi].

This integration will provide:
- [device_tracker](/components/device_tracker/) platform to track nearby bluetooth devices;
- [sensor](/components/sensor/) platform to track the alarms and the timers.

## Configuration

To integrate the `googlehome` integration in Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
googlehome:
  devices:
    - host: IP_ADDRESS
```

{% configuration %}
devices:
  description: A list of Google Home devices.
  required: true
  type: list
  keys:
    host:
      description: The IP address of the Google Home device.
      required: true
      type: string
    rssi_threshold:
      description: The threshold for the RSSI signal of the device.
      required: false
      default: -70
      type: integer
    device_types:
      description: Device types that will be tracked [see device types](#device_types), by default all types are tracked.
      required: false
      type: list
    track_alarms:
      description: Setting to tell the integration to track the alarms of the device.
      required: false
      type: boolean
      default: false
    track_devices:
      description: Setting to tell the integration to track nearby devices.
      required: false
      type: boolean
      default: true
{% endconfiguration %}

## Device types

Device type | Description
