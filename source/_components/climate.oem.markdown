This platform supports the ESP82666 based "WiFi MQTT Relay / Thermostat" sold
by
[OpenEnergyMonitor](https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/wifi-mqtt-relay-thermostat/).
The underlying [library](http://oemthermostat.readthedocs.io/) only supports
this single relay variant of the [original
device](https://harizanov.com/2014/12/wifi-iot-3-channel-relay-board-with-mqtt-and-http-api-using-esp8266/).

This platform controls the setpoint of the thermostat in it's "manual" mode,
therefore there is a configuration option the away setpoint.

To set it up, add the following information to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
climate oem:
  - platform: oem
    name: Home
    host: 192.168.0.100
    port: 80
    away_temp: 14
```

Configuration variables:

- **host** (*Required*): The IP address or hostname of the thermostat.
- **port** (*Optional*): The port for the web interface (defaults to 80).
- **username** (*Optional*): Username for the web interface if set.
- **password** (*Optional*): Password for the web interface if set.
- **away_temp** (*Optional*): Setpoint for the thermostat in away mode (defaults to 14 C).
