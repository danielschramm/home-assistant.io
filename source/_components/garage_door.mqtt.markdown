The `mqtt` garage door platform let you control your MQTT enabled garage door.

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a state topic to publish state changes. If these messages are published with RETAIN flag, the MQTT switch will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the switch will be false/off.

When a state topic is not available, the switch will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the switch will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the switch will wait for state confirmation from device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if state topic is available. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect switch operation.

To use your MQTT binary sensor in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yml entry
garage_door:
  platform: mqtt
  state_topic: "home-assistant/garage-door"
  command_topic: "home-assistant/garage-door/set"
  name: "MQTT Sensor"
  optimistic: false
  qos: 0
  retain: true
  state_open: "STATE_OPEN"
  state_closed: "STATE_CLOSED"
  service_open: "SERVICE_OPEN"
  service_close: "SERVICE_CLOSE"
  value_template: '{% raw %}{{ value.x }}{% endraw %}'
```

Configuration variables:

- **state_topic** (*Required*): The MQTT topic subscribed to receive sensor values.
- **name** (*Optional*): The name of the sensor. Default is 'MQTT Sensor'. 
- **state_open** (*Optional*): The payload that represents open state. Default is"STATE_OPEN"
- **state_closed** (*Optional*): The payload that represents closed state. Default is "STATE_CLOSED"
- **service_open** (*Optional*):  The payload that represents open state in service mode. Default is"SERVICE_OPEN"
- **service_close** (*Optional*): The payload that represents closed state in service mode. Default is "SERVICE_CLOSE"
- **optimistic** (*Optional*): Flag that defines if switch works in optimistic mode. Default is true if no state topic defined, else false.
- **qos** (*Optional*): The maximum QoS level of the state topic. Default is 0 and will also be used to publishing messages.
- **retain** (*Optional*): If the published message should have the retain flag on or not.
- **value_template** (*Optional*): Defines a [template](/topics/templating/) to extract a value from the payload.

For a quick check you can use the commandline tools shipped with `mosquitto` to send MQTT messages. Set the state of your sensor manually:

```bash
$  mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/garage-door/set -m "OFF"
```
