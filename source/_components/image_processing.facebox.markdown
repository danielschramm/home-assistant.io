The `facebox` image processing platform allows you to detect and recognise faces in a camera image using [Facebox](https://machinebox.io/docs/facebox). The state of the entity is the number of faces detected, and recognised faces are listed in the `matched_faces` attribute. Facebox runs in a Docker container, and it is recommended that you run this container on a machine with a minimum of 2 GB RAM. On your machine with Docker, run the Facebox container with:
```
MB_KEY="INSERT-YOUR-KEY-HERE"

sudo docker run --name=facebox --restart=always -p 8080:8080 -e "MB_KEY=$MB_KEY"  machinebox/facebox
```

If you only require face detection (number of faces) you can disable face recognition by adding ```-e "MB_FACEBOX_DISABLE_RECOGNITION=true"``` to the `docker run` command.

To enable this platform in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
image_processing:
  - platform: facebox
    ip_address: 192.168.0.1
    port: 8080
    source:
      - entity_id: camera.local_file
        name: my_custom_name
```
