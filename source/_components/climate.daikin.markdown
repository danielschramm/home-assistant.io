### Description ###

The climate component integrates Daikin air conditioning systems into Home Assistant, enabling control of setting the following parameters:
- **mode** (cool, heat, dry, fan only or auto)
- **fan speed** (on supported models)
- **target temperature**
- **swing mode** (on supported models)

Current temperature is displayed.

<p class='note warning'>
    Please note, the `daikin` platform integrates **ONLY the european versions of Daikin ACs (models BRP069A41, 42, 43, 45)** into Home Assistant.
    BRP069A42 does not support setting of fan speed or fan swing mode.
</p>

### Configuration ###

The component has been integrated with discovery so all your Daikin AC's climate devices can be automatically discovered.
Manual configuration and customization is also possible by using the sample configuration from below:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
climate:
  - platform: daikin
      host: 10.0.0.1
      name: optional name
```

Configuration variables:

- **host** (*Required*): IP or hostname of the device
- **name** (*Optional*): If the device has a name previously set by the user than that name will be used
