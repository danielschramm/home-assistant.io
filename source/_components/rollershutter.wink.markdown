<p class='note warning'>
**This platform has been deprecated in favor of a "[cover](/components/cover.wink/)" platform and will be removed in the future. Please use the cover platform.**
</p>

The `wink` rollershutter platform allows you to control your [Wink](http://www.wink.com/) enabled rollershutters. It supports Wink shades/blinds/rollershutters such as the Bali Somfy or Lutron Serena blinds.

The Wink API currently doesn't provide status for shades.

The requirement is that you have setup your [Wink hub](/components/wink/).
