This component sets up integration with [Plaato Airlock](https://www.plaato.io/).
Plaato Airlock is a tool for beer brewers that wants a unique insight into the fermentation process.
With this integration, you get all your fermentation data available in Home Assistant!

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To configure Plaato Airlock, you must set it up via the integrations panel in the Home Assistant frontend.

This will give you the webhook URL to use in the PLAATO mobile app configuration on the tab "Webhook". 
More information can be found [here](https://plaato.io/apps/help-center#!hc-general).

This sensor platform was not made by Plaato. It is not official, not developed, and not supported by Plaato.
