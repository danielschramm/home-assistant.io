The `plex` platform allows you to connect to a [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv). Once connected, [Plex Clients](https://www.plex.tv/apps-devices/) playing media from the connected Plex Media Server will show up as [Media Players](/components/media_player/) and report playback status via a [Sensor](/components/sensor/) in Home Assistant. The Media Players will allow you to control media playback and see the current playing item.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Media Player](#media-player)
- [Sensor](#sensor)

If your Plex server has been claimed by a Plex account via the [claim interface](https://plex.tv/claim), Home Assistant will require an authentication token to connect. If you don't know your token, see [Finding your account token / X-Plex-Token](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/204059436).

The preferred way to setup the Plex platform is by enabling the [discovery component](/components/discovery/) which requires GDM enabled on your Plex server. This can be found on your Plex Web App under Settings > (server Name) > settings > Network and choose "Enable local network discovery (GDM)".

If your Plex server has local authentication enabled or multiple users defined, Home Assistant requires an authentication token to be entered in the frontend. You will be prompted with a notification to complete configuration if discovery is enabled.

If your server enforces SSL connections, write "`on`" or "`true`" in the _"Use SSL"_ field. If it does not have a valid SSL certificate available but you still want to use SSL, write "`off`" or "`false`" in the _"Verify SSL"_ field as well.

You can also enable the `plex` platform directly by adding the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
plex:
  token: MYSECRETTOKEN
```

<div class='note warning'>
  
At least one of `host` or `token` must be provided.

</div>

{% configuration %}

## Media Player

The `plex` media_player platform will create Media Player entities for each connected client device. These entities will display media information, playback progress, and playback controls if supported by the device.

### Notes

* At this moment, the Plex platform only supports one Plex Media Server.
* It is possible to get errors that look like the following.

  ```txt
  ERROR:plexapi:http://192.168.1.10:32400: ('Connection aborted.', BadStatusLine("''",))
  INFO:homeassistant.components.media_player.plex:No server found at: http://192.168.1.10:32400
  ```

  If this occurs, check the setting `Server`>`Network`>`Secure connections` on your Plex Media Server: if it is set to `Preferred` or `Required`, you may need to manually set the `ssl` and `verify` booleans to, respectively, `true` and `false`.
* Movies must be located under 'Movies' section in the Plex library to properly get 'playing' state.

## Sensor

The `plex` sensor platform will monitor activity on a given [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv/). It will create a sensor that shows the number of currently watching users as the state. If you click the sensor for more details, it will show you who is watching what.
