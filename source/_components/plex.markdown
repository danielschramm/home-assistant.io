The `plex` platform allows you to connect to a [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv). Once connected, [Plex Clients](https://www.plex.tv/apps-devices/) playing media from the connected Plex Media Server will show up as [Media Players](/components/media_player/) in Home Assistant. It will allow you to control media playback and see the current playing item.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Media Player](#setup---media-player)
- [Sensor](#sensor)

## {% linkable_title Setup - Media Player %}

The preferred way to setup the Plex platform is by enabling the [discovery component](/components/discovery/) which requires GDM enabled on your Plex server. This can be found on your Plex Web App under Settings > (server Name) > settings > Network and choose "Enable local network discovery (GDM)".

If your Plex server has local authentication enabled or multiple users defined, Home Assistant requires an authentication token to be entered in the frontend. Press "CONFIGURE" to do it.

</p>

If you don't know your token, see [Finding your account token / X-Plex-Token](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/204059436).

If your server enforces SSL connections, write "`on`" or "`true`" in the _"Use SSL"_ field. If it does not have a valid SSL certificate available but you still want to use it, write "`on`" or "`true`" in the _"Do not verify SSL"_ field as well.

<p class='img'>
  <img src='{{site_root}}/images/screenshots/plex-token.png' />
</p>

You can also enable the plex platform directly by adding the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: plex
```

In the event that [discovery](/components/discovery/) does not work (GDM disabled or non-local Plex server), you can manually create a `plex.conf` file manually and place it in your [configuration directory ](/docs/configuration/) or `/config/` if you are running Hass.io. The following is an example of `plex.conf`:

```json
{"IP_ADDRESS:PORT": {"token": "TOKEN", "ssl": false, "verify": true}}
```

{% configuration %}
IP_ADDRESS:
  description: IP address of the Plex Media Server.
  required: true
  type: string
PORT:
  description: Port where Plex is listening.
  required: true
  default: 32400
  type: integer
TOKEN:
  description: Only if authentication is required. Set to `null` (without quotes) otherwise.
  required: false
  type: string
ssl:
  description: Whether to use SSL/TLS or not.
  required: false
  default: "`false`"
  type: boolean
verify:
  description: Perform a verification of the certificate. To allow invalid or self-signed SSL certificates set it to `false`.
  required: false
  default: "`true`"
  type: boolean
{% endconfiguration %}

### {% linkable_title Customization %}

You can customize the Plex component by adding any of the variables below to your configuration:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: plex
    entity_namespace: 'plex'
    include_non_clients: true
    scan_interval: 5
    show_all_controls: false
    use_custom_entity_ids: true
    use_episode_art: true
    remove_unavailable_clients: true
    client_remove_interval: 600
```

{% configuration %}
entity_namespace:
  description: "Prefix for entity ID's. Useful when using overlapping components (ex. Apple TV and Plex components when you have Apple TV's you use as Plex clients). Go from _media_player.playroom2_ to _media_player.plex_playroom_"
  required: false
  type: string
include_non_clients:
  description: "Display non-recontrollable clients (ex. remote clients, PlexConnect Apple TV's)."
  required: false
  default: false
  type: boolean
scan_interval:
  description: "Amount in seconds in between polling for deviceâ€™s current activity."
  required: false
  default: 10
  type: int
show_all_controls:
  description: "Forces all controls to display. Ignores dynamic controls (ex. show volume controls for client A but not for client B) based on detected client capabilities. This option allows you to override this detection if you suspect it to be incorrect."
  required: false
  default: false
  type: boolean
use_custom_entity_ids:
  description: "Name Entity ID's by client ID's instead of friendly names. HA assigns entity ID's on a first come first serve basis.  When you have identically named devices connecting (ex. media_player.plex_web_safari, media_player.plex_web_safari2), you can't reliably distinguish and or predict which device is which.  This option avoids this issue by using unique client ID's (ex. media_player.dy4hdna2drhn)."
  required: false
  default: false
  type: boolean
use_episode_art:
  description: Display TV episode art instead of TV show art.
  required: false
  default: false
  type: boolean
remove_unavailable_clients:
  description: Remove stale plex clients from UI after interval.
  required: false
  default: true
  type: boolean
client_remove_interval:
  description: How long a client is to be unavailable for before it is cleaned up in seconds.
  required: false
  default: 600
  type: integer
{% endconfiguration %}

### {% linkable_title Notes %}

* At this moment, the Plex platform only supports one Plex Media Server.
* It is possible to get errors that look like the following.

  ```
  ERROR:plexapi:http://192.168.1.10:32400: ('Connection aborted.', BadStatusLine("''",))
  INFO:homeassistant.components.media_player.plex:No server found at: http://192.168.1.10:32400
  ```

  If this occurs, check the setting `Server`>`Network`>`Secure connections` on your Plex Media Server: if it is set to `Preferred` or `Required`, you may need to manually set the `ssl` and `verify` booleans in the `plex.conf` file to, respectively, `true` and `false`. See the **"Setup"** section above for details.
* Movies must be located under 'Movies' section in the Plex library to properly get 'playing' state.

## {% linkable_title Sensor %}

The `plex` sensor platform will monitor activity on a given [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv/). It will create a sensor that shows the number of currently watching users as the state. If you click the sensor for more details it will show you who is watching what.

If your Plex server is on the same local network as Home Assistant, all you need to provide in the `configuration.yaml` is the host or IP address. If you want to access a remote Plex server, you must provide the Plex username, password, and optionally the server name of the remote Plex server. If no server name is given it will use the first server listed. If you use the username and password, all servers in that account are monitored.

If you don't know your token, see [Finding your account token / X-Plex-Token](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/204059436).

If you want to enable the plex sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: plex
```
