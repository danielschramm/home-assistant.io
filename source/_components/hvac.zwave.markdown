**This platform has been deprecated in favor of a "[climate](/components/climate.zwave/)" platform and will be removed in the future. Please use the climate platform.**

To get your Z-Wave `hvac` devices working with Home Assistant, follow the instructions for the general [Z-Wave component](/components/zwave/) and the [HVAC component](/components/hvac/).
