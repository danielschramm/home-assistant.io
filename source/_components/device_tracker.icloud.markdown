The `icloud` platform allows you to detect presence using the [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) service. iCloud allows users to track their location on iOS devices. 

It does require that your device is registered with "Find My iPhone".

To integrate iCloud in Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: icloud
    username: USERNAME
    password: PASSWORD
```

Configuration variables:

- **username** (*Required*): The username for the iCloud account.
- **password** (*Required*): The password for your given username.

<p class='note warning'>
This may cause battery drainage as it wakes up your device to get the current location.
</p>

<p class='note warning'>
You may receive an email from Apple stating that someone has logged into your account.
</p>

<p class='note warning'>
If you have two-factor authentication enabled on your iCloud account you will not be able to use this presence detection in HA, even with an app-specific password.
