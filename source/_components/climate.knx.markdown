The `knx` climate platform is used as in interface with KNX thermostats.

The `knx` component must be configured correctly, see [KNX Component](/components/knx).

To use your KNX thermostats in your installation, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
climate:
   - platform: knx
     name: HASS-Kitchen.Temperature
     temperature_address: '5/1/1'
     setpoint_shift_address: '5/1/2'
     setpoint_shift_state_address: '5/1/3'
     target_temperature_address: '5/1/4'
     operation_mode_address: '5/1/5'
```

Alternatively, if your device has dedicated binary group addresses for frost/night/comfort mode:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
climate:
  - platform: knx
    name: HASS-Kitchen.Temperature
    temperature_address: '5/1/1'
    setpoint_shift_address: '5/1/2'
    setpoint_shift_state_address: '5/1/3'
    target_temperature_address: '5/1/4'
    operation_mode_frost_protection_address: '5/1/5'
    operation_mode_night_address: '5/1/6'
    operation_mode_comfort_address: '5/1/7'
```

If you want to overwrite the supported operation modes use:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
climate:
  - platform: knx
    name: HASS-Kitchen.Temperature
    temperature_address: '5/1/1'
    setpoint_shift_address: '5/1/2'
    setpoint_shift_state_address: '5/1/3'
    target_temperature_address: '5/1/4'
    operation_mode_frost_protection_address: '5/1/5'
    operation_mode_comfort_address: '5/1/7'
    override_supported_operation_modes:
      - "Night"
      - "Standby"
      - "Comfort"
```

`operation_mode_frost_protection_address` / `operation_mode_night_address` / `operation_mode_comfort_address` are not necessary if `operation_mode_address` is specified.

`override_supported_operation_modes` is an array that can contain any of the following values:

- Auto
- Comfort
- Standby
- Night
- Frost Protection
- Heat
- Morning Warmup
- Cool
- Night Purge
- Precool
- Off
- Test
- Emergency Heat
- Fan only
- Ice
- Dry
- NoDem
