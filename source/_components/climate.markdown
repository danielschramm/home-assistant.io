The `climate` component is built for the controlling and monitoring of HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) and thermostat devices.
 
To enable this component, pick one of the platforms, and add it to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
climate:
  platform: demo
```
