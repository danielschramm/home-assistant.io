The `LUPUS-Electronics` security control panel platform allows you to control your [Lupusec](https://www.lupus-electronics.de) devices.

This component will add `door contacts` and `window contacts` to your home-assistant setup

For the sensors to work you have to setup your [Lupusec component](/components/lupusec/).
