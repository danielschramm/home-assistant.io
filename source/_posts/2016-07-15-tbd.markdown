It's time for Home Assistant 0.24 and it's full of new integrations for your Home.

This release brings support for two new ecosystems: [Envisalink] and [Homematic]. We can now also control your TV via HDMI using [HDMI-CEC] (which works on the Pi!) and another cool feature is the [persistent notifications] which allow you to add a notification to the frontend till dismissed.

[Wink] support has been dramatically improved by migrating to the PubNub API. This allows Wink to push changes from their system to Home Assistant. This change came just in time as somehow our Wink integration was causing a lot of requests to their servers. Thanks to Wink for letting us know so we could solve it instead of blocking us.

The [Recorder component][recorder] was migrated to SQLAlchemy. This change will allow the easy integration of other database systems than SQLite in the future.
