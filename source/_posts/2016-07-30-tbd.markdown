We are proud to annonce the availability of Home Assistant 0.25.

The brand-new [iFrame panels][panel] allows you to integrate third-party web frontends into Home Assistant. They will show up in the sidebar and can be used the same way as you open the frontend in your browser but all within one view. 

The [Jupyter] Notebooks allows you to create and share documents that contain code, visualizations, and explanatory text. It a great way to work with your stored information about your home. The [blog] post by [@kireyeu] shows an advanced usecase while our [Notebooks][jupyter-notebooks] in the [Home Assistant Notebooks repository][jupyter-repo] only covers the basics.
