### {% linkable_title Breaking changes %}

- [OpenweatherMap] entity IDs are now like `sensor.owm_temperature`. Previously they were like `sensor.weather_temperature`. Apologies for this change, but we needed to make OpenWeatherMap more generic now that we have many weather platforms.
- The configuration for the [OctoPrint] component was updated.
- The mFi platform ([switch][mfi-switch] and [sensor][mfi-sensor]) are no aligned with the configuration of other platforms.
