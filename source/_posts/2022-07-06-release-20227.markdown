## Improved stability and performance, and Python 3.10

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve on story
- Spelling/grammar
- Something about start up reliability improvements
- Make it more to the point?
- Maybe split YAML from JSON

To add/process into this maybe:
- Fix setup race when config entry is in a setup retry state ([@bdraco] - [#73145]) (noteworthy)
- Prime platform.uname cache at startup to fix blocking subprocess in the event loop ([@bdraco] - [#73975]) (noteworthy)
- Check if requirements are installed in the executor ([@bdraco] - [#71611]) (noteworthy)

{% enddetails %}

The quest of improving the performance of Home Assistant continues. Normally,
we have a section at the end of our release notes, where we tell you about the
performance improvements that have been made. This release, it is a big deal.

For many releases [@bdraco] has been analyzing every single aspect of
Home Assistant and manages to make it faster every single release, but
an exceptional progress has been made this release!

The first one is that our YAML & JSON tooling has been optimized/replaced,
with faster libraries and methods. If you use lots of YAML configuration,
you will seriously notice this a lot when starting Home Assistant or
when reloading things like your automations üöÄ. JSON is used a lot internally
and for communication with the frontend or APIs, making things A LOT snappier.

Devices with an integration error during startup, that are able to self recover,
will now do that instantly as soon as the device is discovered.

We now use an better and faster encryption method for the HomeKit Accessory
Protocol (HAP). This improves the performance of the HomeKit, HomeKit Controller,
and Apple TV integrations and prepares Home Assistant for iOS 16.

Lastly, [@pvizeli] has been working hard to ship Home Assistant on Python 3.10!
Which also brings quite an performance improvement. If you are running the Home
Assistant Operating System or use our container installation method, you will
automatically get this, no need to do anything. üöÄ

## Update firmware of your Z-Wave devices directly from Home Assistant

{% details "TODO" %}

- Update screenshots, maybe an animation?
- Add manual firmware update support for zwave-js devices (#12910) @raman325 (frontend)
- Improve story
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

You can now install and update firmware of your Z-Wave devices directly from
within Home Assistant! On the device page there is now the ability to
upload a firmware to your Z-Wave device.

<p class='img'>

Temporary screenshot. Update in progress...
</p>

## The about page is now beautiful too!

Have you ever looked at the about page in the Home Assistant settings menu?

It was probably one of the least visually appealing pages still in our menus,
and [@zsarnett] seemed to agree. He made it a lot more cleaner and functional.

It now clearly shows the versions of the different components your instance is
made up of, and provides a clean menu to all kinds of Home Assistant related
links.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-07/about-home-assistant.png' alt='Screenshot the new about page from the settings menu'>

## Change any weather unit to your preference

Home Assistant has many [weather services] that can be integrated; it is
great to have a choice! The differences between those are often their
accuracy for your region and the  units of measurement used for the
different weather data points.

But what if you'd like the barometric pressure unit to be in mbar instead of
hPa? Or maybe use m/s or knots instead of km/h for wind speed? No problem!

You can now change the units each weather entity uses! Not just temperature,
but for all of the values a weather entity provides. When changing a unit,
Home Assistant will take care of converting the values for you.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-07/weather-units.png' alt='Screenshot showing energy usage being compared from last week with the week before that'>

As a bonus, this same unit-changing feature is added to the number entities
that represent a temperature. For those number entities, you can now change
the units from Celsius to Fahrenheit (and the other way around).

[weather services]: /integrations/#weather

## Optional labels for gauge cards

{% details "TODO" %}

- Not sure if we should keep this here, might also go into the noteworthy section
- Replace screenshot
- Improve story
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

The guage card can now optionally have labels attached to its segments.
This will cause the label to be shown, instead of the numeric sensor value.

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1550962/173711768-56958cf9-3012-4b6d-aa57-b1e0ee0bf046.png' alt='Gauge card showing a label instead of a value'>
Temporary screenshot. Gauge card showing a label instead of a value
</p>

## Code editors now auto-complete MDI icons

All of our code editors in the frontend now have auto-completions for
MDI icons. Just start typing `mdi:` and it will help you find the exact icon
you need.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-07/icon-auto-complete.png' alt='Screenshot demonstrating auto-complete for MDI icons in the code editors'>

Like the normal icon picker, it supports searching on parts of the icon
name, its aliases and categories. Additionally, it will show a little preview
of the icon you are about to select, so you know you got the right one.

## Filter the history panel

{% details "TODO" %}

- Replace screenshot, as soon as b5 lands

{% enddetails %}

If you have lots of devices and entities then the
{% my history title="history panel" %} can be long! Actually,
it would become so large, that it becomes unpractical. You could always
filter it down to a single entity, but that is fairly limited as well.
For this release, we have improved these filters.

The history can now be filtered by one or more entities, by all entities of
one or more areas, or by all entities of one or more devices.

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663432/176453456-d244f1ee-bf7f-4243-8a2e-204e3f3f5271.png' alt='In the history panel it is now possible to select what you want to see'>
Temporary screenshot. Target selector in the history panel.
</p>

This is super helpful, as you can now view the history of all entities in,
for example, your living room area quick and easy.

{% my history badge %}

## Easily convert values to booleans in templates

If you are into templates, [@pyos] has a surprise for you: We now have a `bool`
function that can be used as a filter too!

If you are a bit into coding, this is not the standard `bool()`, but one that
is very specific for Home Assistant, making it very useful.

This `bool` method converts a value into a boolean and condiders
Home Assistant's specific rules for truthy values. Some examples: `"on"` will
be considered true, and `"disabled"` will be considered false.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-07/bool.png' alt='Screenshot demonstrating auto-complete for MDI icons in the code editors'>

Using `bool` as a filter and combined with and [`iff`](/docs/configuration/templating/#immediate-if-iif)
filter, you can quickly change, for example, binary sensors values into any
text you'd like.

For more information, check out our [Templating documentation].

## Breaking Changes

Below is a listing of the breaking change for this release, per subject or
integration. Click on one of those to read more about the breaking change
for that specific item.

{% details "Python 3.10" %}

Home Assistant now ships with Python 3.10 for the following installation methods:

- Home Assistant Operating System
- Home Assistant Container
- Home Assistant Supervised

You don't have to do anything; this will all happen automatically. However,
this might be a breaking change in case you are using custom integration
that does not support Python 3.10 yet.

([@pvizeli] - [#73830]) ([documentation](/integrations/recorder/#configure-filter))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#73830]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73830

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Bluetooth (multiple integrations)" %}

Home Assistant is upgrading to Python 3.10 this release and comes
with a breaking change affecting multiple integrations.

Known affected integrations at the time of writing:

- [BeeWi SmartClim BLE sensor](/integrations/beewi_smartclim)
- [Bluetooth Tracker](/integrations/bluetooth_tracker)
- [Elgato Avea](/integrations/avea)
- [EQ3 Bluetooth Smart Thermostats](/integrations/eq3btsmart)
- [Leviton Decora](/integrations/decora)
- [Mi Flora](/integrations/miflora)
- [Zengge](/integrations/zengge)

These integrations rely on the `bluepy` and `pybluez` libraries, which no longer
work in newer versions of Python. `bluepy` has seen its last update in
[December 2018](https://pypi.org/project/bluepy/#history) and hasn't
kept up with changes in the Python world.
[Similar story](https://pypi.org/project/pybluez/#history) with `pybluez`.

We can't mitigate this issue. If you are using one of these integrations,
these will no longer work. We rather wanted to see a non-breaking solution,
but we saw no backward compatible path or other solutions to aid this.

If you would like to help fix or upgrade one of these integrations, we
would be grateful. We recommend migrating these integrations onto the
[Bleak](https://pypi.org/project/bleak/) library instead.

([@pvizeli] - [#73830]) ([documentation](/integrations/recorder/#configure-filter))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#73830]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73830

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Entity filters (multiple integrations)" %}

All entity filters, as used by the following integrations:

- [Apache Kafka](/integrations/apache_kafka)
- [Azure Event Hub](/integrations/azure_event_hub)
- [Google Pub/Sub](/integrations/google_pubsub)
- [History](/integrations/history)
- [InfluxDB](/integrations/influxdb)
- [Logbook](/integrations/logbook)
- [Recorder](/integrations/recorder)

Have been adjusted to make entity filters handle includes stronger than excludes.

Filters are now applied as follows when there are domain and glob includes
(may also have excludes):

- Entity listed in entities include: include
- Otherwise, entity listed in entities exclude: exclude
- Otherwise, entity matches glob include: include
- Otherwise, entity matches glob exclude: exclude
- Otherwise, entity matches domain include: include
- Otherwise: exclude

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#74080]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/74080

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Weather (multiple integrations)" %}

This applies to all (weather) integrations providing weather entities.

Previously the units for Weather had not been corresponding correctly with
the documentation. These units are now aligned for pressure and wind speed:

- If the unit system is metric, the default pressure unit is `hPa`,
  and the default wind speed unit is `km/h`.
- If the unit system is imperial, the default pressure unit is `inHg`,
  and the default wind speed unit is `mi/h`.

[#73441]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73441

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Eight Sleep" %}

The Eight Sleep integration migrated to configuration
via the UI. Configuring Eight Sleep via YAML configuration
has been deprecated and will be removed in a future Home Assistant release.

Your existing YAML configuration is automatically imported on upgrade to this
release; and thus can be safely removed from your YAML configuration
after upgrading.

[@raman325]: https://github.com/raman325
[#71095]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/71095

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Glances" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Glances
integration has been removed.

Glances is now configured via the UI, any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

[@engrbm87]: https://github.com/engrbm87
[#72706]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/72706

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Google Calendars" %}

The Google Calendar `google.scan_for_calendars` service has been removed.
Similar functionality can be achieved with the
`homeassistant.reload_config_entry` service, which will reload the
integration and load all new calendars from the API.

([@allenporter] - [#73010]) ([documentation](/integrations/google))

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter
[#73010]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73010

---

The Google Calendar `add_event` service is deprecated and will be removed in
a future Home Assistant release.

A new service `create_event` with equivalent functionality is its replacement,
which is an entity-based service that takes an entity as a target
(rather than a Google Calendar ID).

([@allenporter] - [#72473]) ([documentation](/integrations/google))

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter
[#72473]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/72473

---

Google Calendars no longer supports entity customizations in the UI
when `google_calendars.yaml` specifies the same entity multiple times.

([@allenporter] - [#73715]) ([documentation](/integrations/google))

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter
[#73715]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73715

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Hunter Douglas PowerView" %}

Top Down/Bottom Up shades will now have an entity to control each motor.
You will need to manually remove any old entities by selecting the unavailable
entities from the Home Assistant Interface, selecting "REMOVE ENTITY", and
then confirming the removal by clicking "REMOVE".

- If you have automations to set shade position based on entity ID, you will
  need to reconfigure these as the new entities will be named differently. 
- If you only have automations set to trigger scenes you **do not** need to
  reconfigure automations.

[@kingy444]: https://github.com/kingy444
[#62788]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/62788

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Islamic Prayer Times" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Islamic Prayer Times
integration has been removed.

Islamic Prayer Times is now configured via the UI, any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

([@engrbm87] - [#7287248332]) ([documentation](/integrations/islamic_prayer_times))

[@engrbm87]: https://github.com/engrbm87
[#72483]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/72483

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Kostal Plenticore" %}

The Kostal Plenticore now has number entities. Two existing sensors entities
have been promoted to this platform: "Battery min Soc" and
"Battery min Home Consumption".

If you use these sensors entities in your automation, scripts, or dashboards,
you will need to adjust these for this change.

([@stegm] - [#64927]) ([documentation](/integrations/kostal_plenticore))

[@stegm]: https://github.com/stegm
[#64927]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/64927

{% enddetails %}

{% details "LG Soundbars" %}

The LG Soundbars integration migrated to configuration
via the UI. The automatic discovery of the integration via legacy discovery
has been removed.

This change has no possible migration path; therefore, if you use this
integration, you will have to re-add it manually via the user interface.

([@MasonCrawford] - [#71153]) ([documentation](/integrations/lg_soundbar))

[@MasonCrawford]: https://github.com/MasonCrawford
[#71153]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/71153

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Life360" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Life360
integration has been removed.

Life360 is now configured via the UI. Any "advanced" options in
YAML configuration will be imported. Once the migration is complete,
any `life360` entries in YAML configuration should be removed.

As per other device tracker platforms that have migrated to entity-based,
entries in `known_devices.yaml` will no longer be created, and any existing
entries for `life360` should be removed.

The following options are no longer supported: 

- `circles`
- `members`
- `error_threshold`
- `warning_threshold`
- `max_update_wait`
- `show_as_state: moving`

Additionally, the following entity attributes have been changed:

- Renamed: `battery` -> `battery_level`
- Removed: `moving`, `raw_speed`

If you have been using these attributes in your automations or script, you'll
need to adapt them to this change.

[@pnbruckner]: https://github.com/pnbruckner
[#72461]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/72461

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Mazda Connected Services" %}

The `start_engine`, `stop_engine`, `turn_on_hazard_lights`,
`turn_off_hazard_lights`, `start_charging`, and `stop_charging` services are
removed from the Mazda integration.

They were deprecated in 2022.4 and replaced by button and switch entities.

[@bdr99]: https://github.com/bdr99
[#73403]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73403

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Met Office" %}

Met Office doesn't provide precise visibility distance, only ranges - i.e.,
something like "Very good - 20-40 km".

This doesn't fit into the weather entity model, so it's now removed.
The old value is still available in a separate sensor provided
by this integration.

{% details "Nest" %}

The Nest authentication method called "Desktop", "Installed App" or "OOB" auth
has been [deprecated](https://developers.googleblog.com/2022/02/making-oauth-flows-safer.html#disallowed-oob)
by Google and is scheduled to break existing users in October.

As a result, the Home Assistant Nest integration setup has been streamlined
to help make the transition easier for users. See the integration
documentation for details.

The configuration of the OAuth application credentials for the Nest integration
has migrated to configuration via the UI. Configuring Nest OAuth application
credentials via YAML configuration has been deprecated and will be removed in
a future Home Assistant release.

If you were already using Web Auth, your existing Nest application credentials
in the YAML configuration are automatically imported on upgrade to this release;
and thus can be safely removed from your YAML configuration after upgrading.

{% details "Radio Thermostat" %}

The Radio Thermostat integration migrated to configuration
via the UI. Configuring Radio Thermostat via YAML configuration
has been deprecated and will be removed in a future Home Assistant release.

Your existing YAML configuration is automatically imported on upgrade to this
release; and thus can be safely removed from your YAML configuration
after upgrading.

---

Radio Thermostat's hold mode is now configured using a switch. This replaces
the original YAML configuration option named `hold_temp`.

The integration now only synchronizes time when loaded if the hold mode
is not active. Synchronizing the time when the hold mode is active causes
the hold mode to disable unexpectedly.

{% details "SkyBell" %}

The SkyBell integration migrated to configuration
via the UI. Configuring SkyBell via YAML configuration
has been deprecated and will be removed in a future Home Assistant release.

Your existing YAML configuration is automatically imported on upgrade to this
release; and thus can be safely removed from your YAML configuration
after upgrading.

After upgrading, each Skybell will now have a device for each doorbell.
Also, it has become unnecessary to prefix all entities with "SkyBell",
this may change you existing entities after upgrading and you need to adjust
your automation, scripts and dashboard for this change.

---

The following SkyBell entity attributes have been split out into their own
sensors: last motion event, last button event, last check-in, motion threshold,
video profile, Wi-Fi SSID, Wi-Fi status.

If you rely on these attributes in your automations or scripts, you will need
to adapt them to this change.

{% details "System Bridge" %}

- This integration now requires System Bridge 3.1.2 and above. Any older
  version will no longer work.
- BIOS Version, Idle, System, and User Load sensors have been removed.
  These are no longer available from System Bridge data modules.
- Command service has been removed. This has been removed from System Bridge
  due to potential security issues.
- Open path and URL are now separate services. If you are using the
  old `system_bridge.open` service, you will need to update your
  automation to use the new service(s).
- GPU entities are from a new source, so they may have changed names slightly.
  Any automations using these entities may need to be updated.
- GPU fan speed is now measured in RPM instead of %.

{% details "UniFi Protect" %}

The new disk sensors pull from completely different data than the old ones.
They should be largely compatible for functionality, but orphaned sensors may
still be created. Any orphaned sensors can be safely deleted.

The sensors' naming format has also changed to match what is shown in UniFi
Protect. Additionally, the extra state attribute for the model has
been completely removed since now the slot numbers match what UniFi
Protect displays.

[@AngellusMortis]: https://github.com/AngellusMortis
[#73197]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73197

---

Entities that provided an "edit" configuration interface for Protect devices
(like the HDR Switch or Recording Mode Select) have all now been replaced by
regular sensor entities; if you do not have write access to that UniFi Protect
Device.

These switches, select entities, etc., never actually worked previously since
the user did not have permission to change them, but you could read the status.

Any entities that are orphaned by this can be safely deleted.
