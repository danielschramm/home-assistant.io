Lovelace is the default, yay!

Started originally inspired by @andrey-git who added Custom UI. [Initial PR](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-polymer/pull/1205)

Learned that homes are who people are, thinking that we could magically sort it out and build a UI was a naive approach. To work around the magic, components started to store options to influence the magic.

Lovelace is a re-do, we allow users to get full control. Every card, every entity, all yours. Including custom cards.

Thank a ton to the current and former members of the Lovelace team:

 - @bramkragten
 - @c727
 - @ciotlosm
 - @iantrich
 - @jeradM
 - @thomasloven
 - @zsarnett

Because of the ease to customize and share customizations, we've seen a big community be created around Lovelace. They are very active in the #lovelace channel on our chat, and work is shared on [ShareTheLove.io](https://sharethelove.io/) and the [Lovelace section on Awesome HA](https://www.awesome-ha.com/#lovelace-ui).
