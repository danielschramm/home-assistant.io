I finally took the time to setup a simple website to help people getting started with Home Assistant. The process was super smooth thanks to the great tools [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org) and the great services [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com).
