Sigh. Another one. This time it's not a small one either: Nest is disabling their APIs.

We already saw [the writing on the wall in January](/blog/2019/01/24/nest-cannot-access-data/), but now [it's official](https://developers.nest.com/): Google announced that the Nest API will be turned off at the end of August, 2019. This means that in a little over three months, you will no longer be able to get your own data, that Google has collected in your home, and use it like you see fit.

The reason for shutting down the API is that the Nest team is focusing on making "Works with Google Assistant" the most helpful and intelligent ecosystem for the home. However, and this is crucial: the Google Assistant ecosystem is a one way street. You can put data in, but you can never get data out. They acknowledge this in [their FAQ](https://nest.com/whats-happening/):

Google also [announced](https://nest.com/blog/2019/05/07/introducing-google-nest/) that they are transitioning the Nest ecosystem into the Google world, making you link all your Nest devices to your Google account. How that will work? We're just going to leave this snippet from [this article from the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/d8cbd5e6-70de-11e9-bf5c-6eeb837566c5) here:

Our advice (as always): buy devices that communicate locally.
