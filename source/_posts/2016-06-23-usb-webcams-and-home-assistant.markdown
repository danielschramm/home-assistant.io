In the past month I was thinking about ways to integrate USB webcams into Home Assistant again. The main reason was that this would give those devices a second life and enable one to benefit from low-cost video surveillance. There are a couple of options available like [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html) or [SimpleCV](http://www.simplecv.org/) but I never finished something. With the [Local File camera platform](https://home-assistant.io/components/camera.local_file/) by [Landrash](https://github.com/Landrash) and [motion](http://lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome) you could integrate a local USB webcam with a few very easy steps.

In this blog post I am using a Fedora 24 (will most likely work on other distributions too) installation with Home Assistant 0.22.1 on a Foxconn nT-330i with an old [Logitech QuickCam Orbit AF](http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/quickcam-sphere-af) and a [Logitech HD Webcam C270](http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/hd-webcam-c270). As a start only the Quickcam is used. No multi-camera setup for now.

<!--more-->

Check first if the your operating system lists your cameras.

```bash
$ lsusb
[...]
Bus 002 Device 016: ID 046d:08cc Logitech, Inc. Mic (PTZ)
[...]
```

The camera we are going to use is available at `/dev/video1`. The C270 is the one on `/dev/video0`.

```bash
$ ls -al /dev/video*
crw-rw----+ 1 root video 81, 0 Jun 23 08:05 /dev/video0
crw-rw----+ 1 root video 81, 1 Jun 23 08:36 /dev/video1
```

We need an additional software part to handle the cameras. [motion](http://lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome) is capable of monitoring the video signal from USB and network cameras, do motion detection, and other nifty stuff like saving images, add text, or basic image manipulations. Make sure that you have the [RPM Fusion respository](http://rpmfusion.org/) enabled.

```bash
$ sudo dnf -y install motion
```

For your setup we need to modify the file `/etc/motion/motion.conf`. For now the most important parameters are `videodevice`, `snapshot_interval`, and `target_dir`. We are going to use the device `/dev/video1`, use a 30 seconds interval, and set the path to `/tmp`. Edit `/etc/motion/motion.conf` or use `sed`.

```bash
$ sudo sed -i 's|videodevice /dev/video0|videodevice /dev/video1|g' /etc/motion/motion.conf
$ sudo sed -i 's|target_dir /var/motion|target_dir /tmp|g' /etc/motion/motion.conf
$ sudo sed -i 's|snapshot_interval 0|snapshot_interval 30|g' /etc/motion/motion.conf
```

It's suggested that you adjust at least `width` and `height` to get a bigger image from your camera. Now fire up `motion`.

```bash
$ sudo motion
[0] [NTC] [ALL] conf_load: Processing thread 0 - config file /etc/motion/motion.conf
[0] [ALR] [ALL] conf_cmdparse: Unknown config option "sdl_threadnr"
[0] [NTC] [ALL] motion_startup: Motion 3.3.0 Started
[0] [NTC] [ALL] motion_startup: Logging to file (/var/log/motion.log)
```

Your `target_dir` will start filling up with images from your camera. `motion` will create a symlink called `lastsnap.jpg` which always point to the latest snapshot. We will setup the [Local File camera platform](https://home-assistant.io/components/camera.local_file/) to use this file.

```yaml
camera:
  - platform: local_file
    name: Cranberry cam
    file_path: /tmp/lastsnap.jpg
```

The machine with the attached USB camera will become a webcam server as well because `motion`'s built-in HTTP server is enabled by default. This means that you could connect your USB webcams to a different machine in your network, run `motion` there, adjust your firewall rules, and use Home Assistant to display the videos. Just check http://[IP of your webcam host]:8081/ to see the stream. This required more powerful hardware than using snapshots, of course.

In a scenario like this needs a [Generic MJPEG IP Camera ](https://home-assistant.io/components/camera.mjpeg/) in your `configuration.yaml` file.

```yaml
camera:
  - platform: mjpeg
    mjpeg_url: http://[IP of your webcam host]:8081
    name: Cranberry Live cam
```

[motion](http://lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome) is a powerful tool and this blog post only showed two very simple use cases. Take a look at the [documentation](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/MotionGuide) of `motion` to unleash its potential.
