Well, hello!, Home Assistant Core 0.107! We are happy to see you ðŸ˜ƒ

A great release that improves stability, reliability and a lot of helpful additions to make everything much more friendly and easier to use. So let's dive in!

## Bye State UI, hello multiple Lovelace dashboards

As announced with [0.105](/blog/2020/02/05/release-105), the old states UI is removed in this release. We did a survey to see what people would miss from states UI and found out that it is used mostly as a overview of all entities besides a nice layout that can be made in Lovelace.
We found a solution for that, and then some... You are now able to create multiple Lovelace dashboards. This means you can have a dashboard with your main layout, one that is autogenerated (like State UI), one for experimenting, one for admins, one managed in YAML, one managed in the UI, etc.

You can create unlimited dashboards right from the UI in the new Lovelace config panel. YAML dashboards can be set up in `configuration.yaml`, see the documentation.

This comes with a breaking change for people that use Lovelace in YAML mode, you need to move the `resource` section from your `ui-lovelace.yaml` to the `lovelace:` section in `configuration.yaml`.
For users in storage mode, we automaticlly migrate your resources, they are no longer found in the raw config editor, but in the Lovelace config panel.

## New media player card

[@zsarnett](https://github.com/zsarnett) is back on the frontend team and was not planning on letting that happen unnoticed. He did a ton of work on the frontend and created an awesome new media control card for Lovelace. It is inspired by the media control widget in Android and changes color based on the artwork of the played media. We think it looks really nice!

## Helpers Config Panel

When you create advanced automations, you often need a helper. Like a toggle, to save a state, or another input field. Until now you always had to define them in YAML.
We now have an UI to add and manage these Helper elements, one step closer to not needing YAML anymore!

Other noteworthy changes:

- [@zsarnett](https://github.com/zsarnett) changed the looks of our card picker, instead of a simple button to pick a card, you now get a live preview with your own entities.
- [@thomasloven](https://github.com/thomasloven) added an UI editor for the stack cards and conditional card.
- [@Misiu](https://github.com/Misiu) added an UI to set the visibility per user for views.
