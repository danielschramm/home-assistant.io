This platform allows you to detect presence by looking at connected devices to a [NETGEAR](https://www.netgear.com/) device and control the NETGEAR device.
Both routers and access points can be used with this integration. Some access points will not be automatically discovered and need to be set up manually.

Consider_home:
  description: "The consider home time is the number of seconds to wait till marking someone as not home after not being seen. This parameter is most useful for households with Apple iOS devices that go into sleep mode while still at home to conserve battery life. iPhones will occasionally drop off the network and then re-appear. This option helps prevent false alarms in presence detection."

## Router entities
The NETGEAR router will have the following entities:

### Reboot button

Button entity to restart the router.

### Traffic meter data

The total and average amount of downloaded/uploaded data through the router can be tracked per day/week/month.
In order for these entities to display the data (instead of 0), the "Traffic Meter" should be enabled in the router settings.
Log into your router > Select **ADVANCED** > **Advanced Setup** > **Traffic Meter** > **Enable Traffic Meter** check box.

## Connected device entities

For each device connected to the NETGEAR router the following entities will be available:

### Device tracker

### Allowed on Network

Switch that lets you Allow or Block a device on the Network.
For this entity to actually Block the device, "Access Control" needs to be turned on in the Router settings.
Log into your router > Select **ADVANCED** > **Security** > **Access Control** > **Turn on Access Control** check box.

### Signal strength

### Link rate
