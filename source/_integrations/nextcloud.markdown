## Configuration

This integration requires access to the monitor API of a Nextcloud instance (This is generally an admin user).

You should also generate an App password from the Nextcloud web UI: **Settings** > **Security** > **Devices & sessions** > **Create new app password**.

Once you have generated the App password, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
nextcloud:
  url: Https://YOUR_NEXTCLOUD_URL
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_APP_PASSWORD

```

{% configuration %}
