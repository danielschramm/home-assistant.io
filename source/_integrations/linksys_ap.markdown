The `linksys_ap` platform offers presence detection by looking at connected devices to a Linksys based access point.

It was tested with a LAPAC1750 AC1750 Dual Band Access Point.

## Configuration

To use a Linksys Access Point in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: linksys_ap
    host: 192.168.1.1
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The hostname or IP address of your access point, e.g., `192.168.1.1`.
  required: true
