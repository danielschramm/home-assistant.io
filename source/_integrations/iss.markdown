The `iss` platform uses the
[Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/)
to let you know if the station is above your home location.
This means that ISS is 10Â° above the horizon of your home.

You can check in the attributes of the sensor to see the timestamp for the next
rise of the station, its current coordinates, and the number of people in space.

<div class='note warning'>

If you enable "Show on map" in the options for this integration then the location attributes 
are named `latitude` and `longitude`. The default name of the location attributes is
`lat` and `long` to avoid showing them on the map.
