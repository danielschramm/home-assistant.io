The `script` integration allows users to specify a sequence of actions to be executed by Home Assistant. These are run when you turn the script on. The script integration will create an entity for each script and allow them to be controlled via services.

## Configuration

The sequence of actions is specified using the [Home Assistant Script Syntax](/getting-started/scripts/).

{% raw %}
 
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
script:
  message_temperature:
    sequence:
      # This is Home Assistant Script Syntax
      - service: notify.notify
        data_template:
          message: "Current temperature is {{ states('sensor.temperature') }}"
```

{% endraw %}

<div class='note'>

Script names (e.g., `message_temperature` in the example above) are not allowed to contain capital letters, or dash (minus) characters, i.e., `-`. The preferred way to separate words for better readability is to use underscore (`_`) characters.

</div>

### Script Modes

Mode | Description
-|-
`legacy` | See [below](#legacy-mode).
`error` | Raise an error. Previous run continues normally.
`ignore` | Do not start a new run. Previous run continues normally.
`parallel` | Start a new, independent run in parallel with previous runs which continue normally.
`restart` | Start a new run after first stopping previous run.
`queue` | Start a new run after all previous runs complete. Runs are guaranteed to execute in the order they were queued.

#### Legacy Mode

<div class='note'>

This mode is deprecated, and a warning to that effect will be issued at startup unless `mode: legacy` is specified.

</div>

This mode maintains the legacy script behavior. That is, the script will run until it executes a `delay` step, or a `wait_template` step (that actually waits), at which point the script will suspend. If the script is run while suspended, it will abort the delay/wait_template and continue immediately to the next step, or finish if there are no more steps. Also, calling a legacy script that is still running (and not suspended) will result in an error.

### Full Configuration

{% raw %}

```yaml
script:Â 
  wakeup:
    alias: Wake Up
    icon: "mdi:party-popper"
    description: 'Turns on the bedroom lights and then the living room lights after a delay'
    fields:
      minutes:
        description: 'The amount of time to wait before turning on the living room lights'
        example: 1
    # If called again while still running (probably in delay step), start over.
    mode: restart
    sequence:
      # This is Home Assistant Script Syntax
      - event: LOGBOOK_ENTRY
        event_data:
          name: Paulus
          message: is waking up
          entity_id: device_tracker.paulus
          domain: light
      - alias: Bedroom lights on
        service: light.turn_on
        data:
          entity_id: group.bedroom
          brightness: 100
      - delay:
          # supports seconds, milliseconds, minutes, hours
          minutes: {{ minutes }}
      - alias: Living room lights on
        service: light.turn_on
        data:
          entity_id: group.living_room
```

{% endraw %}

### Passing variables to scripts

As part of the service, variables can be passed along to a script so they become available within templates in that script.

There are two ways to achieve this. One way is using the generic `script.turn_on` service. To pass variables to the script with this service, call it with the desired variables:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: light.bedroom
    from: 'off'
    to: 'on'
  action:
    service: script.turn_on
    entity_id: script.notify_pushover
    data:
      variables:
        title: 'State change'
        message: 'The light is on!'
```

The other way is calling the script as a service directly. In this case, all service data will be made available as variables. If we apply this approach on the script above, it would look like this:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: light.bedroom
    from: 'off'
    to: 'on'
  action:
    service: script.notify_pushover
    data:
      title: 'State change'
      message: 'The light is on!'
```

Using the variables in the script requires the use of `data_template`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
script:
  notify_pushover:
    description: 'Send a pushover notification'
    fields:
      title:
        description: 'The title of the notification'
        example: 'State change'
      message:
        description: 'The message content'
        example: 'The light is on!'
    sequence:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: switch.pushover_notifications
        state: 'on'
      - service: notify.pushover
        data_template:
          title: "{% raw %}{{ title }}{% endraw %}"
          message: "{% raw %}{{ message }}{% endraw %}"
```

### Waiting for Script to Complete

When calling a script "directly" (e.g., `script.NAME`) the calling script will wait for the called script to finish.

When calling a script (or multiple scripts) via the `script.turn_on` service the calling script does _not_ wait. It starts the scripts, in the order listed, and continues as soon as the last script is started.

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/integrations/script/script_wait.jpg'>
</p>

Following is an example of the calling script not waiting. It performs some other operations while the called script runs "in the background." Then it later waits for the called script to complete via a `wait_template`.

{% raw %}
```yaml
script:
  script_1:
    sequence:
      - service: script.turn_on
        entity_id: script.script_2
      # Perform some other steps here while second script runs...
      # Now wait for called script to complete.
      - wait_template: "{{ is_state('script.script_2', 'off') }}"
      # Now do some other things...
  script_2:
    sequence:
      # Do some things at the same time as the first script...
```
{% endraw %}

Note that this is only guaranteed to work if the called script uses a non-legacy mode.

### In the Overview

Legacy scripts in the Overview panel will be displayed with an **EXECUTE** button if the script has no `delay:` or `wait_template:` statement, and as a toggle switch if it has either of those. Scripts configured for any other mode than `legacy` will also be displayed with a toggle switch.

This is to enable you to stop a running script.
