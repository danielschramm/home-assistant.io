The `scrape` sensor platform is scraping information from websites. The sensor loads an HTML page and gives you the option to search and split out a value. As this is not a full-blown web scraper like [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/), it will most likely only work with simple web pages and it can be time-consuming to get the right section.

Check Beautifulsoup's [CSS selectors](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#css-selectors) for details on how to write a **Select**.

If you are not using Home Assistant Container or Home Assistant Operating System, this integration requires `libxml2` to be installed. On Debian based installs, run:

```bash
sudo apt install libxml2
```

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Examples

In this section you find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor. There is also a [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/home-assistant/home-assistant-notebooks/blob/master/other/web-scraping.ipynb) available for this example to give you a bit more insight.

### Home Assistant

| **Unit of Measurement** | `UV Index` |

### IFTTT status

If you make heavy use of the [IFTTT](/integrations/ifttt/) web service for your automations and are curious about the [status of IFTTT](https://status.ifttt.com/) then you can display the current state of IFTTT in your frontend.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Resource** | https://status.ifttt.com/ |
| **Name** | IFTTT status |
| **Select** | `.component-status` |
