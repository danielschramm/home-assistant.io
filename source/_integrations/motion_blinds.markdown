The integration allows you to control [Motion Blinds](https://motion-blinds.com) from [Coulisse B.V.](https://coulisse.com/products/motion).

To add a Motion Bridge to your installation, click Configuration in the sidebar, then click Integrations. Click the + icon in the lower right. Then search for "Motion Blinds" and enter the setup.

You will be asked for the IP address of the Motion Bridge, e.g., 192.168.1.100. Note that a static IP address is required in order for this integration to keep working properly.

## Retrieving the API Key


The Motion Blinds API uses a 16 character key that can be retrieved from the official "Motion Blinds" app for [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/motion-blinds/id1437234324) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coulisse.motion).

Open the app, click the 3 dots in the top right corner, go to "settings", go to "Motion APP About", Please quickly tap this "Motion APP About" page 5 times, a popup will appear that gives you the key.

Please note that "-" characters need to be included in the key when providing it to Home Assistant. The key needs to be similar to `12ab345c-d67e-8f`
