The Kaleidescape integration allows for the automation of Kaleidescape movie players.

Ideas for automation include:

- Playing and pausing a movie sets lighting scenes.
- The start of movie credits turns up the lights.

## Supported Models

This integration is intended for the automation of Kaleidescape players with a movie zone. This includes all Strato and Premier players. Strato players support auto-discovery in Home Assistant. Premier players must be added manually by adding an instance of this integration and specifying the IP address of the player.

## Media Player

The Kaleidescape media player platform will create a Media Player entity for each device discovered on your network. This entity will display the currently playing media and playback controls.
