Home Assistant is built from the ground up to be easily-extensible by other developers using components. It uses [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for the backend and [Polymer (Web components)](https://www.polymer-project.org/) for the frontend.

Home Assistant is open-source and MIT licensed. The source can be found here:
