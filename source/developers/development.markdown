Home Assistant is built from the ground up to be easily extensible using components. Home Assistant uses [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for the backend and [Polymer (Web components)](https://www.polymer-project.org/) for the frontend.

Home Assistant is open-source and MIT-licensed. Here are links to the source::

 - [home-assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant): Python server backend.
 - [home-assistant-js](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-js): JavaScript backend that powers the client.
 - [home-assistant-polymer](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-polymer): Polymer UI.
