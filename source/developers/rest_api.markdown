Home Assistant runs a web server accessible on port 8123.

  * http://IP_ADDRESS:8123/ is an interface to control Home Assistant.
  * http://IP_ADDRESS:8123/api/ is a Rest API.

The API accepts and returns only JSON encoded objects. All API calls have to be accompanied by the header `X-HA-Access: YOUR_PASSWORD` (YOUR_PASSWORD as specified in your `configuration.yaml` file in the [`http:` section](/components/http/)).

There are multiple ways to consume the Home Assistant Rest API. One is with `curl`:

```bash
curl -X GET \
    -H "x-ha-access: YOUR_PASSWORD" \
    http://IP_ADDRESS:8123/ENDPOINT
```

Another option is to use Python and the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) module. 

```python
from requests import get

url = 'http://localhost:8123/ENDPOINT'
headers = {'x-ha-access': 'YOUR_PASSWORD',
           'content-type': 'application/json'}

response = get(url, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

<p class='note'>
You can append <code>?api_password=YOUR_PASSWORD</code> to any url to log in automatically.
</p>

Successful calls will return status code 200 or 201. Other status codes that can return are:

 - 400 (Bad Request)
 - 401 (Unauthorized)
 - 404 (Not Found)
 - 405 (Method not allowed)
